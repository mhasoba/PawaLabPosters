				\item Earth's {\bf Ecosystems} generate the oxygen we breathe and recycle the water we drink.
				\item {\bf Food-webs}, networks of who-eats-whom interactions, form the living ``fabric" of Ecosystems.
				\item Ecosystems are {\bf complex systems} that self-organize into a stable environment for {\bf species} to flourish in.
				\item Ecosystems are under {\bf severe stress} from pollution, species invasions, overexploitation, and climate change.
