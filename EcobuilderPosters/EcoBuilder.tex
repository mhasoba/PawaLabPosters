				\item We are building increasingly {\bf realistic 
				mathematical models of ecosystems} using {\bf theory and data on 
				species interactions} in food webs (the living ``fabric'' of 
				ecosystems). 
				\item Like the real stuff, these {model ecosystems have \bf 
				complex behavior} (Ecosystems are not a sum of their parts) --- 
				Understanding and predicting these complex behaviors 
				require {\bf computer simulations}. 
				\item The {\bf EcoBuilder game} uses one such ecosystem model.
